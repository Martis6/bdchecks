      IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS: STARTED
      Main: Check if distance in space and time between two records is compatible with the available means of transportation at that time
      InputQuestion: Is record collection distance and time is compatible?
      Example:
        Fail: Distance in space and time between two collected items from the same collector are incompatible with the available means of transportation at that time (maximum distance that can be travelled in the period).
        Pass: Distance in space and time between two collected items from the same collector are compatible with the available means of transportation at that time (maximum distance that can be travelled in the period).
        InputFail: Two records collected by the same person before 1850, the first in day X and the next in day X + 1 are more than 1000km apart, which is the maximum distance that people could travel at that time.
        InputPass: Two records collected by the same person before 1850, the first in day X and the next in day X + 1 are at the distance that people could travel at that time.
