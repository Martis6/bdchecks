    notes:
      1: Lee Belbin - This needs discussion. For example, would kingdom, phylum, class or order only be useful?
      2: JW - Would this test return true if there were data in the relevant Taxon-related fields was meaningless (effectively null)?

    notes:
      1: Paula Zermoglio - The specification here is tricky. It might perfectly be that sciName is empty and that genus and specificEp are filled in. As it stands, it could only run AFTER sciName has been inferred from genus+spEp.
      2: Paul Morris - Name needs to change. Unavailable means something other than not supplied to taxonomists.. dwc:taxonId should be included, it also specifies the name
      3: Paul Morris - Name, definitions, and specification are inconsistent. It isn;t clear if this is a measure of multiple terms or a test for conformance against a vocabulary.

    notes:
      1: Paula Zermoglio - I believe DwC terms should include some more, e.g., island, islandGroup, waterbody, county, municipality, continent, countryCode.
      2: Arthur Chapman - This is a complicated test - needs more work to document. Not georeferenced or not georeferenceable.. Need to add many dwc:terms. If all relevant spatial terms are blank or uninterpretable.
      3: Paul J. Morris - Extensive discussion in the meeting - has georeference or is georeferencable is one possible interpretation, but a very complex one to implement, and supported by other more granular tests. We decided to constrain this test to a simple test of minimal presence of some sort of spatial data.
