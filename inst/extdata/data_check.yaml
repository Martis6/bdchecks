    notes:
      1: Lee Belbin - This needs discussion. For example, would kingdom, phylum, class or order only be useful?
      2: JW - Would this test return true if there were data in the relevant Taxon-related fields was meaningless (effectively null)?

    notes:
      1: Paula Zermoglio - The specification here is tricky. It might perfectly be that sciName is empty and that genus and specificEp are filled in. As it stands, it could only run AFTER sciName has been inferred from genus+spEp.
      2: Paul Morris - Name needs to change. Unavailable means something other than not supplied to taxonomists.. dwc:taxonId should be included, it also specifies the name
      3: Paul Morris - Name, definitions, and specification are inconsistent. It isn;t clear if this is a measure of multiple terms or a test for conformance against a vocabulary.
